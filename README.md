These data visualizations refute the claim that data breaches are becoming less severe. <br />

1. Increase in data breach sensitivity throughout the years

This chart shows that over time the data breach sensitivities are not getting less severe. The sensitivity is far worse than the earlier years in 2004.
<br />

Advantage: Shows a trend that the sensitivity levels are increasing over the years.<br />
Disadvantage: Doesn't show the organization so the graph is too general. Doesn't allow the audience to take any actions<br />
Next version: would be good to also show the method of leak to see where the audience should be focusing<br />

<br />
2. Data Breach Sensitivity per Method of Leak over Time

This chart shows that over time the data breaches are getting more severe and that the majority of these leaks are caused by hackers.
<br />

Advantage: Shows that the majority of the data breach intensity is caused from hackers <br />
Disadvantage: The graph doesn't show if there are a lot of lower sensitivities or a few of higher sensitivities <br />
Next version: Include the number of rows per year to see what the true averages are
