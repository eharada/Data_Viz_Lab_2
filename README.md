These data visualizations refute the claim that data breaches are becoming less severe. <br />

1. Increase in data breach sensitivity throughout the years

This chart shows that over time the data breach sensitivities are getting more severe. The sensitivity is worse than the earlier years in 2004.
<br />

Advantage: Shows a trend that the sensitivity levels are increasing over the years.<br />
Disadvantage: Doesn't show the organization so the graph is too general. Doesn't allow the audience to take any actions<br />
Next version: would be good to also show the method of leak to see where the audience should be focusing<br />

<br />
2. Data Breach Sensitivity per Method of Leak over Time

This chart shows that over time the data breaches are getting more severe and that the majority of these leaks are caused by hackers. We should be focusing our efforts on preventing hackers from accessing our data.
<br />

Advantage: Shows that the majority of the data breach intensity are caused by hackers <br />
Disadvantage: The graph doesn't show if there are a lot of lower sensitivities or a few of higher sensitivities <br />
Next version: Include the number of rows per year to see what the true averages are 

3. Final Chart: Increased Ratios of Data Records Lost per Data Breach

Red line shows the total records lost while the blue line shows the total number of breaches per year. <br/>

This chart shows the comparison between the total number of records lost versus the number of breaches there were per year. We can see that the data breaches are more severe because there are less breaches but more number of records lost per breach. Towards the tail end of 2017 it shows that there are more breaches but less records lost. However we don't have the full data for 2017 (still need data for October-December) to get the full picture. <br/><br/>
I wanted to exclude the method of leaks as I felt that was too much information for one graph. 
<br/><br/>
Advantage: Shows the severity of our data breaches as there are higher ratios of records lost per data breach. <br/>
Disadvantage: Doesn't show enough data of where the method of leaks are. Still a bit ambiguous of where we should focus our efforts. However it might be too much to show the method of leaks.
